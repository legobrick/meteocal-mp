\chapter{Overall Description} \label{cap:cap1}
\section{System Environment}
WeatherCal is a stand alone software made from scratch. It is a Web application that allows the registered users to manage their schedule basing on the weather conditions. The users are also able to invite people to their event and to publicize their event.  
The system is even capable of notifying the users, as they log on to the system, if the weather forecast for the event is not the desired one.
\subsection{Actors}
Actors in the system are mainly the people registered into the web application. They will be referred as Registered Users.
Whoever is not yet registered on the platform will be an actor for the system too and it will be identified as an Anonymous  Users.
No administration is required since the system is not intended for illicit purposes and this is a policy of the platform, plus no conflict among users can occur since the only allowed interactions are the invite to an event and a participation to an event (in which other people partecipate).
