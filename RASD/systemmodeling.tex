\subsection{Use Case Diagrams}
\subsubsection{Event Management}
The use case in figure~\ref{fig:eventusecase} shows how a user can manage his agenda. After he logs into the platform he will see his calendar and being able to see schedule of his events. This event can be modified and so deleted or if the user is the event's owner he can invite other users.

\subsubsection{View other profiles}
The use case in figure \ref{fig:otherprofileusecase} shows how an user can reach the profile of an other user and view his agenda. After he logs in to the platform he will be able to search an user and see his profile, but he will be authorized to see the other user's calendar only if it set as public by its owner.

\subsubsection{Bad Weather}
The use case in figure \ref{fig:otherprofileusecase} explains how an user can behave when he get notified by the platform in case of bad weather condition. Whenever he receives a bad weather notifications the user can act in two different way. If he's the event's owner he can delete the event or modify the event's location while if he's an event's participant he can only manage his event's participation.
