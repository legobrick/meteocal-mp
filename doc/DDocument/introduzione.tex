\chapter{Introduction} \label{cap:cap1}

\section{Purpose}
This document describes the high level design and the technology involved in the development of the WeatherCal software. The target will be accomplished by the use of a description of the architecture which comes after the analisys of the problem and the constraint, explained in \autoref{cap:cap2}. The final design and how the application will be developed is shown in \autoref{cap:cap3}. This document is a supplement of the RASD formerly redacted.
In this document the structure of the system is described, both from the client and the server perspective and we explain how and why some design choices were taken.

\section{Scope}
This document is intended for the stakeholders of the system, the developers and reviewers/testers.
