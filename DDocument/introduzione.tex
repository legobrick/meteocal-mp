\chapter{Introduction} \label{cap:cap1}

\section{Purpose}
This document describes the high level design and the technology involved in the development of the WeatherCal software. The target will be accomplished by the use of a description of the architecture which comes after the analisys of the problem and the constraint, explained in \autoref{cap:cap2}. The final design and how the application will be developed is shown in \autoref{cap:cap3}. This document is a supplement of the RASD formerly redacted.
Provide an overview of the entire document.

\section{Scope}
This document is intended for the stakeholders of the system, the developers and reviewers/testers.
