\chapter{System} \label{cap:cap2}

\section{System Description}
The system will implement a calendar as a web application, splitted into client-side and server-side. The former will be used for implementing the asyncronous facilities delivered in the calendar, while the ladder will be used both as an interface for the former to interact with the persistency and for providing web pages to the client.

\section{Design Constraints}
Describe the general constraints implied by the design process and what are the impacts on the system architecture and modules design (time, tools, resources, etc.).\\
Describe constraints imposed by limited hardware resources.
SW Constraints.\\
Describe constraints imposed by software environment (e.g. OS, languages, etc.)

\section{System Architecture}
Describe the chosen system architecture. For instance, architectural design patterns can be used to describe the system: peer-to-peer, client/server, stand-alone or embebbed systems, etc. 
Include also discussion or description of alternative designs
